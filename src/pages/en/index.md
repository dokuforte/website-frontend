The main goal of Dokuforte is to preserve the common past of the Israelis, their everyday lives since the 19th century through the times of the young state of Israel, till 1998. This way we could consequently pass this common past to our future: our children. 

In order to achieve this goal, Dokuforte locates, digitalizes and gathers photographs, primarily from individuals, families and from professional photographers, public institutions as well. We will be pleased to see your photographs here, too. You can either upload them or [contact us](mailto:dokuforte@gmail.com) to have them processed.
